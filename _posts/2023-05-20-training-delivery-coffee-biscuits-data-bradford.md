Coffee, Biscuits and Data is an awareness workshop, developed within the ELIXIR-UK Fellowship for both on-site and online, to build awareness of data management in research-performing organisations.

Nilam Khan, ELIXIR-UK Fellow and Xenia Perez Sitja, Community Manager for the Fellowship delivered this awareness session in May 2023 in person to staff and students across all faculties interested in data management. 

The event gathered a diverse group of PhD candidates and master students, all the way up to senior researchers and principal investigators.
