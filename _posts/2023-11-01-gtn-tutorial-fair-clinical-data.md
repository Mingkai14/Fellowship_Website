The life science community is generally very good at sharing omics data on platforms such as GEO and ArrayExpress. However, the metadata and clinical data associated with the omics datasets are often incredibly sparse. Tracking down the meta- and clinical data of omics datasets can be time-consuming for both data owner and researcher and is a significant hurdle when trying to explore enriched omics data.

In this tutorial, you will learn the benefits of making clinical datasets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and how to make them FAIR.
